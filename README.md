# My-Profile
This is my first personal project on github, My first published website.

# A little insight into Calabim
This is my online profile for my path into learning Software Development.

## My Career Passions
I love computers. I have been fascinated all my life by them and have struggled to navigate what it means to be into computing. So this time into the rabbit hole I am fully emersing myself into study and knowledge of computing and hope to show other confused noobs the path to follow by documenting my journey. 

## My Hobbies
Gaming has been my lifelong passion, combined with my love of Warhammer. So I don't think I'll ever play another game again other than The Total War-Warhammer Series. 
I also love Liverpool FC and the Dallas Cowboys.
